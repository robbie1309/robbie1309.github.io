      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
      <p class="p-two">After searching through many different career paths from firefighter to hairdresser, my eyes were attracted to web developement and software engineering. 
 I've since studied and created many different aspects of the computer science field. I feel as though my studies and learning have a long way to go; however, 
 the growth needs to be within a great company. A company that can push not only my career, but my knowledge and understanding of the studies even further.</p>
